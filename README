These are some shell scripts I wrote to interact with few web API's.
If the news search scripts are used together with a URL aware terminal 
(such as roxterm) you can click on the URLs and are taken to the webpage 
with your favorite browser.  In order for these scripts to work, you
need to register with the corresponding webpage and get an API key.
